						<p> I grew up moving to a new city every few years because of my father's job, so I am extremely adaptable with whatever life hands me! I like to exercise and visit coastal destinations. I have a calm, inviting presence that often results in tourists asking me for directions. I'm also really great at figuring out the optimal arrangement of furniture in a room (both aesthetically and to maximize space), spelling (my friends quiz me often with hard words and I usually get them right), and teaching myself new software.
						</p>
						<p> My career in technology started at Apple in 2011. I was hired as a part-time salesperson and after some very hard work was promoted to a full-time position at the Genius Bar. I also started taking night courses in HTML and CSS.
						</p>
						<p> I am ready to learn more and have wanted to get started in programming for quite some time. I'm eager to dive in!
